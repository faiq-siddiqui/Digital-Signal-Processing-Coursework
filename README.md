# Digital Signal Processing Coursework
## All MATLAB-based exercises, assignments, and lab tasks I completed for EE-394 Digital Signal Processing, a 3rd year course taught as part of BE-Electrical Engineering at NEDUET, Karachi.

## MATLAB Wheel Aliasing Assignment
A challenging but rewarding MATLAB-based bonus task in which a static image of a wheel (or similar object) had to be rotated using MATLAB's `imrotate` command.
The image was then written to a video file with a specific number of rotations per frame. The balance between the actual rate of rotation of the wheel and the
rate at which frames were added to the video (sampling frequency) determined whether the wheel was undersampled, oversampled, or critically sampled.

I really enjoyed this task because it was the first time I worked with images and videos using MATLAB.

The report can be found [here](./MATLAB-Aliasing-Assignment/ee_16163_bonus_task_1.pdf).
